# description 
    RiskReady is a mobile-based application designed to support emergency
preparedness and first aid literacy among Filipino communities. The app consolidates essential resources into a user-friendly interface, enabling quick access to life-saving information during critical situations. It features a categorized directory of emergency contacts, including local fire departments, disaster risk reduction offices, and medical hotlines, with options to filter by city, initiate direct calls, and manage
personalized entries. In addition to contact management, RiskReady offers a comprehensive set of first aid guides covering scenarios such as adult CPR, choking, bleeding control, burns, fractures, shock, heat-related illnesses, and poisoning. These guides are structured for rapid comprehension and are accessible offline, ensuring usability in low-connectivity environments. The application also includes a curated
list of safety tips that promote proactive preparedness, such as creating family emergency plans, assembling 72-hour survival kits, securing household hazards, and learning basic first aid and CPR. Navigation is facilitated through a tab-based system, allowing users to switch seamlessly between modules labeled Contacts, First Aid, Tips, Favorites, and More. Designed with cultural relevance in mind and by
combining intuitive design, localized content, and evidence-based practices, RiskReady contributes to the broader goals of public safety, health education, and community resilience.


## How It Works:
1. City Filter: Users can select a city from the dropdown menu (e.g., Davao City, Tagum City, Panabo City) to view all the emergency contacts for that area. 2. Add City: Users can tap the “Add City” icon button on the AppBar to register a
new city not included in the default list. The new city will appear in the dropdown list
automatically. 3. Add Contact: The “Add Contact” floating button allows users to create and save
new emergency contacts under any city. 4. Favorites: Tapping the heart icon beside any contact adds it to the Favorites tab
for faster access.
5. Call Directly: Tapping any contact will automatically launch the phone dialer with
the selected number ready to call. 6. Data Saving: The app uses SharedPreferences to store favorites and custom cities
locally — ensuring that added data remains available even after the app is closed.
